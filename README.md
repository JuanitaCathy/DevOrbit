## 💫 Project description
Hey there! Welcome to DevOrbit, the ultimate space for devs to pair program, share code snippets, and work together. Whether you're looking to work on a project, brainstorm new ideas, or just have a random chat about your favorite tech topics, DevOrbit has got you covered. It's where magic happens—think of it as your coding spaceship?

## 🚀 The Idea
The idea behind DevOrbit was to create a space where developers from around the globe can connect and collaborate based on their interests. I find myself to be very efficient when I code alongside some hardworking folks on my idea, it keeps me going and sometimes even give rise to new ideas during chat. So yes, that is kinda the idea behind DevOrbit.

## ✨ Major Features! 

- **SignUp/SignIn 🔐:** Social login using Google is used
- **Room Creation and Joining :** Easily create or join rooms to collaborate with others.
- **Tags based room filter 🔍:** Search for rooms using tags on tech the room is using.
- **Video Meetings 🎥:** Video meetings with screensharing, pinning, picture-in-picture mode etc.
- **Chat 💬:** Communicate with other participants in real-time using Socket.io.
- **Excalidraw :** Each room has its own Excalidraw whiteboard session that in-room users can make use of.
- **Room Info Box :** Handy information about the current room.
- **Task Management 📝:** Stay organized with a task list feature.
- **Timer ⏱️:** Keep track of your sessions with a built-in timer.

*🌍 DevOrbit is designed to handle small to medium-sized groups of developers efficiently. However, currently the participants per room is capped to limit costs. In the future, we can scale by Optimizing Three.js ie, enhancing the performance of the interactive landing page :)*
